description: 'Tesla banked almost $1.5 billion last week, selling new shares - to fund the launch of its now hotly anticipated Model 3 - at a healthy $215 per share. The ease with which it raised the funds (and the fact that its shares rose 5% the week of the sale), shows how easily Tesla is able to use Wall Street to do its bidding.'
