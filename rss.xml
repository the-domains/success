The ease with which it raised the funds (and the fact that its shares rose 5% the week of the sale), shows how easily Tesla is able to use Wall Street to do its bidding.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/715e2ea543ce971b60813b040010cff6f7d44a70.jpg"></article>]]></description>
